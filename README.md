# World-cup-tweets-analysis
This repository contains the code that was used to scrape and analyze tweets that were posted during one of the 4 recent FIFA World Cups. It is part of research for a paper for the course IN4252 at TU Delft.

To run the code, simply run the two python files (with Python version 3.7 or higher). Make sure to run and finish the `scraper.py` (this will take at least 5 hours) before running the `analysis.py`.
